Hi I'm Pearl, and I like clouds, mountains, plankton, and being optimistic about environmental solutions! :sparkles: :smile:

I am a climate scientist turned climate risk professional, with over 6 years of experience in academia, climate risk, sustainability, and climate policy across governments and large corporations. My work spans leading climate research and engineering teams, developing decarbonization strategies, and delivering data-driven insights for governments, Fortune 500 companies, and international frameworks.

Currently at Sillion, I oversee climate risk modeling and ESG product development for FTSE100/250 clients, integrating sustainability strategies into major regulatory and reporting frameworks. I lead quantitative modelling and transition planning projects for clients across several sectors, present findings to boards and executives, and help drive organizational alignment with global climate goals.

Previously, at Bloomberg, I worked on creating the data model for the first free and open climate disclosure platform. Done in collaboration with the UN, national governments, and industry leaders, I managed teams of 40 analysts and engineering contractors. My contributions have supported policy frameworks such as CDP and ISSB. It has enabled decision-making at the highest levels, including COP27 and COP28, and my insights have been delivered directly by President Macron and Michael Bloomberg.

In academia and non-profit sectors, I have contributed to pioneering climate research and initiatives, including at the University of Cambridge and within DEI-focused organizations. My career reflects a consistent ability to navigate the changing climate landscape, engage diverse stakeholders, and deliver results that shape impactful sustainability strategies.

I hold degrees in Atmospheric Science and Data Science from the University of Cambridge, and University of British Columbia.

🌿 Hi, I’m Pearl!
I’m endlessly curious about clouds, mountains, plankton—and how optimism can spark real environmental solutions ✨.

Professionally, I work at the intersection of climate science, technology, and strategy. I build and lead teams that design advanced models of climate and nature-related risks, turning complex data into tools that help businesses, policymakers, and investors make smarter sustainability decisions.

My career has taken me from start-ups and scale-ups to global organizations—helping launch open climate data platforms with the UN, advising world leaders, and shaping strategies for industries from finance to construction and tech.

Along the way, I’ve had the privilege to collaborate with scientists, engineers, and policymakers, all united by a drive to create solutions that scale.

I hold a BSc in Atmospheric Science from the University of British Columbia, and MPhil in Atmospheric Physics from the University of Cambridge. I stay motivated by finding joy in the natural world, and find optimism in tackling its biggest climate challenges 🌍.

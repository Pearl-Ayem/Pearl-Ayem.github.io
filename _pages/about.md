Hi I'm Pearl, and I like clouds, plankton, cartoons, and being optimistic about environmental solutions! :sparkles: :smile:

My latest work is with the kind folks at [Net Zero Data Public Utility](https://www.nzdpu.com/) as their Climate Data Analyst. I provide solutions for data analysis, emissions modeling, cloud computing, cloud data architecture and development of open climate data solutions. My work seeks to integrate decarbonization targets into investment workflows and aid the development of sustainability disclosure solutions for financial institutions and corporate clients. 

I hold degrees in Atmospheric Science and Data Science from the University of Cambridge, and University of British Columbia. I've worked with all sorts of climate data on a variety of projects in academia and corporate finance; using statistical and analytical techniques on large, multi-dimensional datasets and machine learning. My work is listed on the projects page in my prtfolio. Drop me an email with any questions, or your favourite weather joke!

# Summary:

I’m a climate risk professional working at the intersection of science, technology, and strategy. My work spans developing advanced risk models, advising on sustainability integration in business and finance, and supporting decision-making at both organizational and policy levels. I’ve contributed as a technical and scientific expert, helped shape international frameworks with heads of state and policymakers, and worked hands-on within start-ups and scale-ups to bring innovative climate solutions to market.

At Risilience, I lead the design of environmental and supply chain risk models that quantify climate and nature-related exposures and translate them into actionable insights for global clients. I oversee multidisciplinary teams of modellers, data scientists, economists, and engineers, delivering digital tools that scale into SaaS products and inform executive-level strategy across sectors from asset management to construction and technology.

Previously at Sillion, I oversaw climate risk modeling and ESG product development for FTSE100 clients, integrating sustainability strategies into major regulatory and reporting frameworks. I led quantitative modelling and transition planning projects for clients across several sectors, present findings to boards and executives, and help drive organizational alignment with global climate goals.

At Bloomberg, I helped create the Net-Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU), the first free and open climate transition data platform, developed in collaboration with the UN, national governments, and global financial institutions. This work was showcased at COP27 and COP28, directly informing climate negotiations and policy discourse at the highest levels. I managed teams of analysts and engineering contractors from Google, along with working directly for Heads of State such as Mark Carney, Emmanuel Macron, and several MPs. My insights have been delivered directly by President Macron and Michael Bloomberg.

In academia and non-profit sectors, I have contributed to pioneering climate research and initiatives, including at the University of Cambridge and within DEI-focused organizations. My career reflects a consistent ability to navigate the changing climate landscape, engage diverse stakeholders, and deliver results that shape impactful sustainability strategies.

I hold degrees in Atmospheric Science and Data Science from the University of Cambridge, and University of British Columbia.

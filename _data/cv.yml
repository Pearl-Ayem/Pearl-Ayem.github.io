        - To address this global data challenge, French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions Michael R. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.nzdpu.com/french-president-emmanuel-macron-and-un-secretary-generals-special-envoy-for-climate-ambition-and-solutions-michael-r-bloomberg-announce-a-climate-data-steering-committee-to-advise-how-to-ca/">created the Climate Data Steering Committee</a> (CDSC) in June 2022. 
        - At its core, the Committee aims to serve the climate objectives of the United Nations by driving forward global momentum to build a broadly accessible foundation of high-quality climate data that is critical to delivering a net-zero economy. Soon after its creation, the CDSC convened global regulators, policymakers, civil society organizations, and other financial market participants to consider and advise on what data is needed to support and accelerate the net-zero transition. 
        - In September 2022, the CDSC <a href="https://www.nzdpu.com/climate-data-steering-committee-proposes-recommendations-for-the-development-of-first-ever-publicly-accessible-climate-data-utility/">released a draft white paper</a> outlining its proposed recommendations for the development of a Net-Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU or Utility) for public consultation. The NZDPU would be an open, free, and centralized data repository that would allow all stakeholders to easily access key climate transition-related data, commitments, and progress of businesses and financial institutions toward those commitments.After incorporating public feedback, the CDSC <a href="https://www.nzdpu.com/climate-data-steering-committee-announces-next-steps-for-groundbreaking-net-zero-data-public-utility/">released its recommendations at COP27</a>, proposing a pilot version of the NZDPU. Review our <a href="https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/71/2022/11/nzdpu-recommendation-development-process-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recommendations Development Process</a> on how changes were made to the white paper in response to public consultation feedback.
